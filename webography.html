<td>With the rise of digital media, we are starting to see less physical copies of items or media that we all love. There are streaming networks, e-books, even video games that aren't hard copies anymore. At the invention of these items, they were seen as convenient and innovative, now physical media is more invasive. It is getting harder to find physical media which is important because it never changes and works the same. It is important for there to be a balance. Online Edited by Michal Kate Castleman.</td>
<td>In this article, the author is questioning whether digital media will fully overtake traditional media. She then discusses the benefits of digital media which are things like increased choices, easily accessible and constantly updated. Then she lists the benefits of physical media which are uncompressed quality, it is completely yours (no hidden fees) and it can be taken and also accessed anywhere. In the end, she realizes that digital is taking over but it is also a preference base. Written by Lauren Cancienne</td>

<td>Attention Span is defined as the amount of time someone can concentrate on one task without being distracted. Recent studies have grappled with the average time of attention spans nowadays but there is a stark difference because one relates to when digital devices are in use and the other is just simply doing a task. Our Attention spans can vary because of age, activities and also gender. Our attention spans are shorter because of digital devices but they can be rebuilt by just doing simple tasks again.</td>
<td>The next article is a script from a podcast that talks about why our attention spans are shrinking. Things hold our attention for a lot less longer than it did in the decades before us. With our phones constantly being able to receive communication and information from all over the world, our brains are pulled in multiple directions constantly. The numbers that are showing from the past years that this is becoming the new normal with our attention span shrinking as technology is growing. By Gloria Mark PHD and Kim Mills</td>

<td>Having Media Literacy is an important skill to have and it is a must to be taught in classrooms today. Teaching Media literacy allows the students to apply their critical thinking skills, intake information and come to a competent conclusion. It must be shown that this skill is something that can and should be used in all life situations that it may be needed. It can allow for powerful insights and connections to be made and explored because it's basically just the art of asking questions to come to a fair conclusion. Written by Faith Rogow</td>
<td>With information being so easily accessible in today’s world, it is also just as easy to read some misinformation on the internet. Having digital media literacy allows you to use the internet but also understand and discern the information that is being presented. The internet allows a lot of people to be experts in fields that they weren’t even students in. You have to know how to fact check and use real life clues to reach a proper conclusion. This skill is very important to have today as Artificial Intelligence is overtaking everything. Written by Brad Smith</td>
